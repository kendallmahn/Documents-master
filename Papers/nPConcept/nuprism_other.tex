%\section{Cross section measurements in $\nu$PRISM \label{sec:nuprism_xsec}}
% Outline for XSEC
%% Two ways to understand nuPRISM: mono energetic beams => xsec  measurements and direct measurement for oscillation experiments.
%% Section discusses implications for a T2K-style beam (Hyper-K or T2K). 
%% this section considers implications of monoeneregtic beams.

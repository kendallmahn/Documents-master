\section{Measurements with CC $\nu_{\mu}$ candidates \label{sec:nuprism_numu}}

As discussed in the previous section, $\nu$PRISM can reconstruct large, pure samples of charged current
events with a muon candidate and no other particles above Cherenkov threshold.  For each event, the
off-axis angle $\theta_{OA}$ is reconstructed and this observable implies additional information about the
distribution of possible neutrino energies based on the prior flux model.  Data binned in $\theta_{OA}$ and the
usual muon observables of momentum (or kinetic energy) and scattering angle are used to constrain the
cross section model.  In the typical approach, the data may be unfolded to find the cross-section in the
true variable of neutrino energy, muon momentuma and muon scattering angle.  However, unfolding relies 
on regularization to deal with the ill-defined nature of the problem, and may not perform well when 
unfolding for $\theta_{OA}$ to the neutrino energy.

We take an alternative approach of using the off-axis neutrino spectra impinging on $\nu$PRISM as a set of basis
functions.  We then write a spectrum of interest as a linear combination of the off-axis spectra:
\begin{equation}
F_{\nu_{\mu}}(E_{\nu}) = \sum_{i} c_{i}\phi^{i}_{\nu_{\mu}}(E_{\nu}).
\end{equation}
Here $F_{\nu_{\mu}}(E_{\nu})$ is an arbitrary function of interest, $\phi^{i}_{\nu_{\mu}}(E_{\nu})$ is the predicted spectrum
in the $i^{th}$ off-axis angle bin and $c_{i}$ are simply coefficients.  The challenge is to find a set of $c_{i}$
that approximatly satisfy the equation while minimizing the statistical and systematic uncertainties that are propagated through the
linear combination.  Once the $c_{i}$ are found, we can write a similar equation for the observables:
\begin{equation}
N(p_{\mu},\theta_{\mu}|F_{\nu_{\mu}}(E_{\nu})) = \sum_{i} c_{i}N^{i}(p_{\mu},\theta_{\mu}).
\end{equation}
In this way, the final state particle multiplicities and kinematics can be measured for an given choice of 
of the input neutrino energy spectrum.  For neutrino cross section measurements, one may choose an input spectrum that
approximates a mono-energetic beam.  For neutrino oscillation
